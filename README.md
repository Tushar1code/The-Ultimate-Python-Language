  - Basic Data Types:
  - int: Integer numbers (e.g., 10).
  - float: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14).
  - str: Strings for text (e.g., "hello").
  - bool: Boolean values (True, False).
  - Variables: Assigning variable values (e.g., x = 10).

- **Day 2: Conditional Expression**
  - `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements
  - Relational and logical operators
